<p>I&rsquo;m a research scientist in the <a href="https://deepmind.com/research?filters=%7B%22tags%22:%5B%22Neuroscience%22%5D%7D">Neuroscience</a> team at <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a>, where I&rsquo;m working on building better memory systems for  artificial agents (see below).</p>
<p>Previously, I was a postdoc with Andrew Davison at the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/dyson-robotics-lab">Dyson Robotics Lab</a> at Imperial College London, where I worked on real-time distributed inference and abstraction in spatial / visual perception systems.</p>
<p>Before that, I did a PhD with Neil Burgess in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/space-memory#research">Space and Memory Group</a>, which is a neuroscience lab at University College London. The lab is interested in how the brain builds useful representations (&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_map">maps</a>&quot;) of the world, and how those representations can be used for decision making. I wrote my thesis on how the brain might construct these representations by &ldquo;replaying&rdquo; memories during sleep.</p>
<h3 id="a-memory-manifesto">A Memory Manifesto</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in building memory systems that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast</strong>: If you show humans a new thing $x$, they can immediately tell you whether it is like another thing $y$.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong>: We can quickly restructure our knowledge given new data. You take a wrong turn on your route to work and after some time arrive at some familiar (but unexpected) landmark. You don&rsquo;t just update your belief over where you are now - you also correct the entire trajectory that in retrospect, you must have taken to get there. You might even be able to figure out which wrong turn you took.</li>
<li><strong>Attentive</strong>: We <em>cache</em> (store) and retrospectively make sense of data. If data doesn&rsquo;t fit into our current understanding of the world, we can still later revisit and integrate that data if something in our understanding has changed. If I told you that <em>Memphis</em> was the capital of <em>Kemet</em>, it might not mean a lot to you. But you might still remember that I told you this fact. If you later learned that <em>Kemet</em> is the old world name for <em>Egypt</em>, you could retroactively integrate this as <em>Memphis</em> was the capital of what is now <em>Egypt</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Sample-efficient</strong>: You or I can get the gist of some concept $c$ from very few examples, sometimes only one. Most existing AI systems are very data hungry.</li>
<li><strong>Robust</strong>: If you teach me a lot about dogs over a concentrated period of time, then teach me a lot about cats, I won&rsquo;t &ldquo;overwrite&rdquo; the stuff I learned about dogs.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical</strong>: Oaks and pines are both types of tree. Sons and daughters are both types of child. Oaks are to pines as sons are to daughters.</li>
<li><strong>Probabilistic</strong>: If you ask me a question, I can give you an answer, tell you how sure I am, and give you my $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}&hellip;n^{th}$ next best guesses. If there are several strong candidates, this order might change depending on the context.</li>
</ul>
